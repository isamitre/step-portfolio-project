        <h3>SHPE <a href="https://membershpeuf.netlify.app/">Website</a></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I joined SHPE's software engineer team in September 2019</li>
          <li>I was part of the effort to completely rewrite the SHPE UF website using 
              MERNG (Mongoose, Express, React, Node, GraphQL)</li>
          <li>I made a tasks feature that lets admins make a task that members can later
              claim for points. When a member claims they have completed the task, the 
              request gets sent to the admins requests page where they can then reject or 
              deny the request. A member can also bookmark tasks for easy access.</li>
          <li>I don't believe this feature is on the final website yet but I'm done with it! 
              (I just finished and made my pull request literally last week)</li>

        <h3>Photography <a href="http://isabelmitre-photography.appspot.com/">Website</a></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Made at CSSI 2019 because I was annoyed with my team members and
              I wanted to practice the skills I learned.</li>
          <li>A photography website with several webpages of photos that, when clicked,
              open up a modal of the larger photograph.</li>

        <h3>Minesweeper</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Made in Programming 2; it was the final project 
              and it took me way too long to complete</li>
          <li>And when I say that I mean it took me a little more than 20 hours (I blame 
              an issue with my computer)</li>
          <li>Besides the common features of the game there is also a debug button which 
              lets you toggle the visibility of the mines on the board and three predetermined
              boards.</li>
