                <ul>
                    <li>Last semester I took a class on Bee Research, so now I know a little bit about beekeeping.
                        I took the class because I was scared of bees. </li>
                    <li>I have always liked gardening and in my first semester I took a gardening class. 
                        I'm sure the tomato plants I left in Gainesville are missing me. </li>
                    <li>I crotcheted with a friend once a week while still in college. I made 
                        a little snake plant and gave it to another friend for her birthday. </li>
